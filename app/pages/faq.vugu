                        Vugu files (.vugu) do not generally contain any JS at all, only Go code. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, access from a WebAssembly program to the Document Object Model does require calls to JavaScript methods.
                        There is a small JavaScript file used internally by Vugu during the render process which is automatically
                        embedded in each Vugu app.
                        Also, Go's WebAssembly
                        support currently requires wasm_exec.js to be loaded, another small file that provides some needed support and integration
                        for the Go runtime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But everything else is just Go code running as WebAssembly.  For example when a handler for a click is registered, Vugu will
                        call the appropriate <code>addEventListener</code> method on the DOM.  And when the event is fired, 
                        the relevant data is collected up about the event on the JS side and a call is then made into your Go Wasm program
                        with the event info.
                        Everthing else is Go from there: Vugu receives the event and makes the appropriate call to your code.

                      This significantly reduces the size of WebAssembly executables and often produces .wasm files measured in 
                      hundreds of kilobytes.</p>
                      <p>
                          Using the default Go compiler, the binaries can be big, yes.  
                          However, they gzip better than one might expect for a binary.  The average 
                          browser download of compressed content for a reasonably-sized program is several megabytes.
                          For some use cases this is completely workable, others it's a problem.
                          Future improvements in size can be expected as the WebAssembly spec and Go's support for it both evolve.

                          The calls between the Go WebAssembly binary at the browser to access DOM are not terribly fast.
                          Last I checked it was around ~75µs per call (although it might be faster calling the same method over and over)
                          and while it tries to minimize those calls it does have
                          to do a lot of them when it builds out the DOM on the page.  But so far, 
                          overall UI speeds have generally been managable.  For many applications speed won't be a problem, and it will only get faster 
                          as things improve.

                        which helps give developers expectations on API compatibility.  No release date is set for Vugu 1.0, so
                        if you need some guarantee of API stability you can lock to a specific development version.

                    <p>
                        A major refactor was done between Vugu v0.1.0 and v0.2.0, which among other things, involved
                        a shift from dynamically registered components to component references being expressed 
                        statically so they are resolved at Go compile time.  This was a major breaking change but was necessary to handle some fundamental
                        issues that came up with the initial prototype for this project.  While major breaking changes
                        are unfortunate, the goal is to get those out of the way early, so 
                        stability improves moving forward.  It is expected that the scope of the changes 
                        will continue
                        to narrow and be more involved with adding features rather than rewriting things.

                  <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Short answer: Because <strong>templates do not provide type safety</strong> or other compile-time checks.</p>
                    <p>
                        This was a major decision in Vugu's overall design and was not made lightly.  There are certainly arguments in favor
                        of using templates, such as the fact that some expressions are shorter to represent and easier to understand.  Templates 
                        also can be evaluated at runtime and do not require a Go compiler.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is contrasted by the fact that one of the major drawbacks to building a large user interface in JS is the 
                        lack of type safety and other compile-time checks.  The TypeScript people invented a whole new language to address the problem. 
                        The larger
                        the code base, the more you need types and a compiler.  Modern UIs can be very sophisticated and Vugu intends
                        to support complex projects well.  To do that, we need to leverage the Go compiler, which means that templates have
                        Go expressions in them, not template code.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, it is not impossible that html/template support will be added to Vugu as an additional feature in the future.
                        <!-- It's also possible for a fully-templated implementation of
                        components to be made (after all, <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#ComponentType">ComponentType</a> is just an interface, 
                        and anything that can generate virtual DOM and instantiate some data can be a component);
                        this could potentially be of use for components that are loaded dynamically at runtime.  These ideas certainly warrant 
                        further discussion and exploration. -->

                      One of the core ideas behind Vugu is that it is fundamentally a library, rather than a framework.
                      The distinction being that with a framework, it calls your code.  With a library, you call it.
                      It is considered vital to the success of this project that we use existing Go tools and not try 
                      to unnecessarily wrap things or obscure the regular tools that Go developers are used to.
                      At the end of the day, Vugu programs are just regular Go programs - with a main function and 
                      you call some methods in the Vugu library. Keeping that idea in place as the project evolves
                      is a core concept behind Vugu.
