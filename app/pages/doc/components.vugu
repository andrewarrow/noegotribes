                    <p>
                      <strong>Components are individual files which are used to organize your user interface code.</strong>
                      Each component lives in a .vugu file.  Each .vugu file is processed to produce 
                      a .go file.  Like all Go code, each directory is a package and you may add 
                      additional .go files to it and use them as part of your component.
                      Vugu does some 
                      code generation, but otherwise does not interfere with the regular Go build 
                      process at all.  Code-generated files end with <em>_vgen.go</em>.
                    </p>

                    <!-- <p>
                      Under the hood, components implement the 
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#ComponentType">ComponentType</a> 
                      interface.  Although this is 
                      unimportant to most developers as the code generator does the work to 
                      implement it based on your .vugu file.
                    </p> -->

                    <p>
                      By default, the component named <strong>root</strong> (and thus living in root.vugu) <strong>is the top 
                      level component</strong> and is rendered just inside the <code>&lt;body></code> tag on your page.
                      In this case, there is only one instance of your root component, which is created in your <code>main()</code> function.
                      (If you've followed the 
                      <a href="/doc/files/start">Getting Started</a>
                      instructions you can find this code in main_wasm.go)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Things get interesting when we introduce the idea of <strong>multiple components</strong> into an application.
                      Each component goes in its own .vugu file.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It's important to remember that under the hood, components are just Go structs.
                      All component references are resolved at compile-time.  There is intentionally
                      as little magic involved as possible.  In fact, components are really just implementations
                      of the <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#Builder">Builder</a>
                      interface and simply provide a <code>Build</code> method with HTML nodes they output.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Static Component References</h2>

                    <p>
                      One component can include a <strong>tag that indicates the name of
                      a component struct to use.</strong>.  
                      When this happens, it says that an instance
                      of this other component should be created.  Let's look at an example:
                    </p>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<!-- root.vugu -->

<div class="root">
    <ul>
      <main:MyLine FileName="example.txt" :LineNumber="rand.Int63n(100)" ></main:MyLine>
    </ul>
</div>

<script type="application/x-go">
import "math/rand"
</script>
`)'></div>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<!-- my-line.vugu -->

<li class="my-line">
  <strong vg-content=&apos;c.FileName&apos;></strong>:<span vg-content=&apos;c.LineNumber&apos;></span>
</li>

<script type="application/x-go">
type MyLine struct {
    FileName string `+"`"+`vugu:"data"`+"`"+`
    LineNumber int  `+"`"+`vugu:"data"`+"`"+`
}
</script>`)'></div>

                      <p>In this case the <code>&lt;main:MyLine></code> tag gets replaced with the <code>&lt;li></code> tag and its contents as 
                        rendered by the MyLine component.  The reference is emitted directly into the code generated file and resolved at Go compile time.
                      </p>

                      <p><code>main</code> is the name of the package.  The name of the current package ("main" or otherwise) is removed
                      in the generated code, but otherwise all package names are regular Go references.  Import statements are required
                      in order to access components in other packages.</p>

                      <p>
                        As shown in the example, HTML attributes starting with a capital letter correspond to struct field assignments.
                        Attributes with a colon (<code>:</code>)
                        will be evaluated as Go code and then the result used as-is (not converted in any way). 
                        This allows you to pass arbitrarily complex data, or pointers, etc. into components when needed.
                      </p>

                      <!-- <p>
                        The <code>NewData</code> method on the component type is responsible for reading the props 
                        passed into it and populating the data struct for this component instance.
                        (This method is part of satisfying the
                         <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#ComponentType">ComponentType</a> interface.)
                      </p> -->

                      <p>
                        Components can be instantiated as many times as needed. Each one causes a new instance 
                        to be created.  Like so:
                      </p>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<!-- root.vugu -->

<div class="root">
    <ul>
      <main:MyLine vg-for=&apos;i := 0; i < 10; i++&apos; 
        FileName="example.txt" :LineNumber="i" ></main:MyLine>
    </ul>
</div>
`)'></div>

                      <p>Components used in this way also support additional features including dynamic properties, as follows:</p>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<pkg:Comp 
    StringField="some string"
    :DynamicField=&apos;/* some go expression */ 123.0&apos;
    stringAttrMapValue="some string"
    :dynamicAttrMapValue=&apos;/* some go expression */ 123.0&apos;
    @Something=&apos;/* ... */&apos;
    ></pkg:Comp>
`)'></div>
                      <ul>
                        <li><code>pkg</code> is the package name - it must correspond to an import statement 
                          or be the same as the current package.</li>
                        <li><code>Comp</code> is the name of the component struct.  
                          No mangling is performed on it, or any of the fields mentioned below.
                        It should be an exported type (start with a capital letter).</li>
                        <li><code>StringField</code> is assigned as a regular Go struct field 
                          using the string "some string"</li>
                        <li><code>DynamicField</code> is assigned as a regular Go struct field but 
                          <code>/* some go expression */ 123.0</code> is emitted directly into the 
                          code-generated file and thus evaluated as Go code.</li>
                        <li><code>stringAttrMapValue</code> (lower-case first letter) is assigned as a 
                          key of to a field that you must declare as <code>AttrMap vugu.AttrMap</code> (an alias for <code>map[string]interface{}</code>) - 
                          this allows you to accept arbitrary values as component input, or not.</li>
                        <li><code>dynamicAttrMapValue</code> (lower-case first letter) works like 
                          <code>stringAttrMapValue</code> but is evaluated as Go code instead of a static string.</li>
                        <li><code>@Something</code> is used for <a href="#component-events">component events, see below.</a></li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>The <code>vg-key</code> attribute can also be specified on a component reference to indicate an additional value which 
                      should be used for caching purposes.  Generally this is a key used in a loop iterator.  Note that loops will automatically 
                      select the key from the <nobr><code>vg-for</code>,</nobr> but you can override what is used for caching purposes by specifying 
                      <nobr><code>vg-key</code></nobr> on your component reference.</p>

                      <p>The <code>vg-var</code> attribute, if specified, will cause a Go variable declaration statement to be 
                      made with the value of the component created.  I.e. <code>&lt;pkg:Comp vg-var="a" ...</code>
                      will result in <code>var a = /* component reference */</code> in the resulting Go code.  This allows you to access the component 
                      and its fields and methods directly as <code>a</code> when needed.</p>

                      <!-- <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                        <i class="icon-alert-circle"></i>
                        <h4 class="fs-22">Please Note</h4>
                        <p>
                          The syntax for custom component tags will likely be changed from
                          <code>pkg:Comp</code> to <code>pkg-Comp</code>.
                          The rationale is that using a colon creates an ambiguity between components
                          and HTML namespaces such as <code>svg</code>, and since component types are 
                          always exported (start with a capital letter), this makes <code>pkg-Comp</code> unambiguous 
                          from other customs tags which would be all lower case.
                          If this change is made both syntaxes will be supported for a while in 
                          order to ease transition.
                        </p>
                      </div> -->
                      
                      <p>
                        Any component can include any other component. But if components include each other 
                        in a loop the behavior is undefined (but I can promise you it won't be good).
                      </p>

                      <h2 id="lifecycle">Component Lifecycle</h2>

                      <p>
                        At runtime, components are created and destroyed as needed, based on the logic in your application that declares what is supposed to be 
                        displayed at a given moment.  For example, a <code>vg-if</code> expression can be used to turn a section of output on or off.  If this section
                        includes one or more components, the necessary components are created as needed.  Other mechanisms such as <code>vg-for</code>
                        (and in combination with the <code>vg-key</code> attribute) are used to describe more complex cases of where a component needs to exist multiple
                        times and indicates the exact key used to identify which component is which.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Regardless of the exact logic for each case, the concept is the same: Components are created when needed, remain as long as they are needed, and destroyed
                        as soon as a render occurs where that component was not needed.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The following methods can be defined on a component and will be called at the appropriate time during the build/render process:
                      </p>

                      <ul>
                        <li><strong><code>Init(ctx <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#InitCtx">vugu.InitCtx</a>)</code></strong> 
                          is called when a component is created before any other callbacks and gives an opportunity to <em>initialize</em>.</li>
                        <li><strong><code>Compute(ctx <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#ComputeCtx">vugu.ComputeCtx</a>)</code></strong>
                          is called each time before the output of a given component is built.
                          It provides an opportunity to <em>compute</em> any necessary information for each render pass.
                          (NOTE: this was previously called <em>BeforeBuild</em>.)</li>
                        <li><strong><code>Rendered(ctx <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#RenderedCtx">vugu.RenderedCtx</a>)</code></strong>
                          is called <em>after each render</em> pass has completed and all DOM elements have been synchronized with the page.</li>
                        <li><strong><code>Destroy(ctx <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#DestroyCtx">vugu.DestroyCtx</a>)</code></strong>
                          is called when build/render pass occurs and it is discovered that a component is no longer needed and gives an opportunity to 
                          <em>destroy</em> any resources no longer used.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>
                        For convenience, on each of these the <code>ctx</code> paramter is optional and if omitted it will be called without it.  E.g <code>Init()</code> can be used if you don't need the context.
                        The context on each does provide an <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#EventEnv">EventEnv</a>, which is useful if you need to trigger a re-render (see next).
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Here's an example of a component that defines each of these lifecycle callback methods and gives an idea of their intended use:
                      </p>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<!-- my-comp.vugu -->

    shortItemCount int

func (c *MyComp) Init(ctx vugu.InitCtx) {

    // kick of loading data from an endpoint
  
    c.Loading = true
    go func() {

      resp, err := http.Get("/some/endpoint")
      if err != nil {
          log.Printf("Error fetching: %v", err)
          return
      }

    }
    c.shortItemCount = count

}

func (c *MyComp) Rendered(ctx vugu.RenderedCtx) {

    // if you really need to manipulate DOM directly after it is rendered, you can do it here

    if ctx.First() { // only after first render
      el := js.Global().Get("document").Call("getElementById", "some_id_here")
      _ = el // do something with an element manually after the first render
    }

}

func (c *MyComp) Destroy() {

                        <p>
                          With the implementation of these lifecycle events, some minor changes were made to the generated main_wasm.go file.  If you are updating an existing
                          project from a prior Vugu version you may need to delete main_wasm.go and let it get regenerated using the latest Vugu version.
                        </p>
                      </div>

                      <h2 id="component-events">Component Events</h2>

                      <p>Unlike <a href="/doc/dom-events">DOM events,</a> events for components are really just a means of receiving
                        a simple method call.  Vugu provides some facilities to declare and use your own events quickly and easily.</p>

                      <p>
                        The <code>@</code> symbol followed by an exported Go field name (starts with an uppper case letter)
                        is a shorthand for an assignment to this field name as follows:
                      </p>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<pkg:Comp @Something="log.Println(event)"></pkg:Comp>`)'></div>
                      is shorthand for:
<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<pkg:Comp 
  :Something=&apos;func(event pkg.SomethingEvent) { log.Println(event) }&apos;
  ></pkg:Comp>`)'></div>

                      <p>In this case <code>pkg.Comp</code> would be a struct with a field called
                        <code>Something</code> of type <code>SomethingHandler</code>. (See more explanation below.)
                      </p>

                      <p>To faciliate creating component events, the code generation syntax 
                        <nobr><code>//vugugen:event Something</code></nobr> exists to automatically emit the appropriate types and 
                        interfaces if you do not declare them yourself.  Let's look at a complete example:
                      </p>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<!-- root.vugu -->

<div id="top">
  <main:Thing 
    @Click=&apos;c.ShowText = fmt.Sprintf("%#v",event)&apos;
    ></main:Thing>
  <div vg-content="c.ShowText"></div>
</div>

<script type="application/x-go">
import "fmt"
type Root struct { ShowText string `+"`"+`vugu:"data"`+"`"+` }
</script>
`)'></div>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<!-- thing.vugu -->

<div>

                        In this case our <code>Thing</code> has a field called Click which is of type 
                        <code>ClickHandler</code>. Each of the related types: 
                        <code>ClickEvent,</code> <code>ClickHandler,</code>

                        exist.  This field can then be easily assigned with
                        <code>&lt;main:Thing @Click='...'></code> as shown.

                        <h4 class="fs-22">Tip: Component Event Naming</h4>
                        <p>The suggested approach for naming events is to use the name of the action in the present tense.
                          i.e. 'Save' rather than 'Saved' or another variation.</p>
                        <p>
                            If the component event name corresponds directly to a DOM event, use the camel case version, i.e. 
                            DOM event "click" becomes ClickEvent defined with DOMEvent embedded into it
                            <code>type ClickEvent struct { vugu.DOMEvent }</code>. (The code generator for <code>//vugugen:event Click</code>
                            will do this for you if you do not otherwise declare <code>ClickEvent</code>.)
                            This makes less hassle when writing code that involves similar DOM and components events
                            and they can be used in similar ways. For example 
                            <nobr><code>&lt;pkg:Comp @Click='event.PreventDefault()'></code>,</nobr> following this convention,
                            would have the same and expected behavior as <nobr><code>&lt;button @click='event.PreventDefault()'></code></nobr>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Also, your event types may be declared as either structs or interfaces.  Use whichever is most appropriate for your 
                          situation. For simple one-off events structs are probably more appropriate.  For complex events 
                          that have deep and meaningful implications throughout a large app, and interface might be better.
                        </p>
                      </div>

                      <p>
                        Again, this system of naming is intended to make it simple to create custom events for your components 
                        that are both type-safe and easy to use.  If you need to do something more sophisticated you can use 
                        the <code>:Something=</code> syntax to assign an arbitrary Go expression to a field and this works 
                        perfectly well for component events as well.  Remember, components events are just regular struct 
                        field assignements, with some tooling to make them easier to use with the @ syntax.
                      </p>
  
                      <!-- What about the fact that vugu.DOMEvent is passed around by ptr but component events not - we want
                      the ability to use an interface Aha! DOMEvent should be an interface instead of a struct with
                      hidden fields, that's exactly the thing.  Can be implemented with an unexported domEvent struct. -->
                  

                      <h2 id="vg-comp">Dynamic Component References</h2>

                      <p>Component references can also be done dynamically based on an arbitrary Go expression.  This is done with 
                        a <code>&lt;vg-comp expr="">&lt;vg-comp></code> tag, and the expression must 
                        resolve to a type compatible with <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#Builder">vugu.Builder</a>.
                        This allows you to instantiate a component in your own Go code and reference it directly during render.  Example:
                      </p>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<!-- root.vugu -->
<div>
    <vg-comp expr="c.MyChildComp"></vg-comp>
</div>

<script type="application/x-go">

type Root struct {
    MyChildComp vugu.Builder
}

func (c *Root) Init() {
    c.MyChildComp = &someother.ComponentHere{}
}

</script>
`)'></div>

                      <h2 id="slots">Slots</h2>

                      <p>Slots are a mechanism that allow you to pass content (or logic that generates content) into another 
                        component, so it can output it in the appropriate place.  Slots are implemented by emitting 
                        a Go anonymous function which outputs the markup you specify, converts it to a 
                        <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu#Builder" target="_blank">vugu.Builder</a>, 
                        and assigns it to a field on a component struct.  Example:
                      </p>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<!-- root.vugu -->
<div>
    <!-- content placed directly inside a component is "DefaultSlot"-->
    <main:MySlottedComp>
      <div>This goes in the DefaultSlot</div>
    </main:MySlottedComp>

    <!-- or we can specify mutliple slots with names-->
    <main:MySlottedComp vg-var=&apos;myParentComp&apos;>

      <vg-slot name="DefaultSlot">
        <div>This goes in the DefaultSlot</div>
      </vg-slot>

      <vg-slot name="AfterSlot">
        <div>This goes in the AfterSlot: 
          <span vg-content=&apos;fmt.Sprintf(myParentComp)&apos;></span></div>
      </vg-slot>

    </main:MySlottedComp>

</div>
`)'></div>

<div vg-content='codefmt.Show("html",`<!-- my-slotted-comp.vugu -->
<div>

    <!-- will render DefaultSlot here if not-nil-->
    <vg-comp expr=&apos;c.DefaultSlot&apos;></vg-comp>

    <!-- will render AfterSlot here if not-nil-->
    <vg-comp expr=&apos;c.AfterSlot&apos;></vg-comp>

</div>

<script type="application/x-go">

type MySlottedComp struct {
    DefaultSlot vugu.Builder
    AfterSlot vugu.Builder
}    

</script>
`)'></div>

                      <p>As you can see above, content directly inside a component tag is assigned to the "DefaultSlot". 
                        Or the <code>&lt;vg-slot></code> tag can be used to assign to an explicitly named slot.
                        Inside in the implementation of the slotted component, <code>&lt;vg-comp></code>
                        is used to output the slot content (see above for more info on vg-comp).  You can also see 
                        in the example that slots can access the component they are "inside" via a variable name 
                        declared with <code>vg-var</code>.
                      </p>

                      <p>Dynamic slot names are also available using the syntax <code>Field[IndexExpr]</code> as the 
                      slot name.  In this case, <code>Field</code> must be of type <code>map[string]vugu.Builder</code>
                      and <code>IndexExpr</code> must be a valid expression to be used for assignment into the map.</p>

                      <p><small>TODO: Once a "data table" component is created this will provide a good example for 
                        how dynamic slots are handled and this documentation should be updated accordingly.
                        But the core idea is that slots are just functions, and since they can access the parent 
                        component from the scope they are declared in (via the vg-var attr), 
                        a data table can for example have a field 
                        like <code>CurrentIndex int</code> and a slot that handles an individual row can read 
                        that field upon each iteration to determine which record it's supposed to output.
                        This is in contrast to how Vue deals with "scoped slots". 
                        In Vugu, you don't "pass" things into slots,
                        instead they just read from the scope they are declared in.  This sounds strange 
                        initially but it allows the various references to be type-safe and avoids passing 
                        around interface{}s with type assertions.  Slots can understand the context in which 
                        they are called and the input data, the component that has the slot itself should 
                        understand as little about its input as possible.  A similar approach is used
                        for things like sort.Slice in the Go standard library - where the caller understands
                        what it is sorting, and the code in the sort package knows only how to sort.
                        It works well there. Likewise, components with slots only know where and in what sequence
                        they output slot content, not all the details about what data they are dealing with.
                        (This even applies if there is a bunch of crazy reflection code to provide nice 
                        pretty output by default by inspecting, e.g. a slice that is passed to a data table -
                        it still doesn't change the basic idea.)
                        This whole concept should be explained clearly and in detail with examples 
                        once some more experience is gained.</small>
