<p>The development setup described in 
                      <a href="/doc/start">Getting Started</a>
                      is a great way to get going with Vugu. But 
                      when you're ready to move your application to a staging or production environment (or you need
                      to do development work on the Go server part of your web application), additional steps 
                      are in order.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Adding a Server</h2>

                    <p>The server you created on the Getting Started page is only a single file (devserver.go), 
                      it does not
                      compile as part of your application (due to the <code>// +build ignore</code> at the top).
                      The main reason for this is that it makes things simpler when you are just hacking away
                      on your user interface.  If you enter bad code into a .vugu file (which ends up 
                      in a .go file and breaks your build), <code>go run devserver.go</code>
                      will still run.
                    </p>

                    <p>To make a proper server suitable for staging or production, or to start adding more 
                      server-side functionality, you'll want to create a server.go file, and place separate 
                      web server code in here.  It is suggested you leave devserver.go where it is and you can 
                      use it if/when needed, it won't conflict with server.go.
                    </p>

                    <p>Note that server.go looks really similar to devserver.go in the beginning.  But 
                      as you add server-side functionality other things to server.go, the need for it 
                      becomes more apparent.  We also have some additional command line flags that 
                      are useful for an application running on a server.</p>
                    <p>This example includes a <code>-dev</code> flag to 
                    enable automatically performing Vugu code generation and rebuilding your 
                    wasm (same as devserver.go), which you can turn on and off.
                    Running without <code>-dev</code>, this can also serve as a viable production server.
                    (Obviously you need to be aware of your specific production environment requirements,
                    but this will get you pointed in the right direction.)</p>
                    <p>Command line flags for the HTTP listener and the directory to look for files in are 
                    also included. <strong>server.go</strong>:</p>

                    <p>
                      To run this server, you can either build the binary and run it directly, or <code>go run . -dev</code>
                      also works.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Making dist.go</h2>

                    <p>
                      Rather than introducing third party build tools, the suggested approach to distributing your 
                      application is to create a small file called dist.go (ignored by the rest of your application)
                      that you run when you want to build your distribution.  The 
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://godoc.org/github.com/vugu/vugu/distutil">distutil</a> package has some 
                      convient functions that make this less tedious than it might seem.  This approach also
                      has the advantage that it works equally well on Windows, Linux and Mac, and without 
                      having to install anything.  The Go module system takes care of that for you.
                    </p>

                    <p>Various steps are possible and there is not a one-size-fits-all dist.go.  That said,
                      here's one that will get you started:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="pb-2">It creates a <strong>"dist" folder, copies the static files</strong> from your project into it</li>
                        <li class="pb-2">It finds and copies <strong>wasm_exec.js</strong></li>
                        <li class="pb-2">It makes sure <strong>vugugen</strong> is installed</li>
                        <li class="pb-2">It runs <strong>go generate</strong></li>
                        <li class="pb-2">It <strong>builds your main.wasm</strong> file</li>
                        <li>And if desired you can make it <strong>write out an index.html</strong> or build your <strong>server executable</strong></li>
                      </ul>

                    <p>
                      By dropping the above is dist.go and tuning it, you can run <code>go run dist.go</code>
                      and get a <code>dist folder with the distribution of your project</code>, ready for 
                      deployment.  And you can of course easily call this from another build/distribution system, 
                      such as a Dockerfile.
